2 main types of web services: REST and SOAP.

1. REST it's an architecture, SOAP - is a protocol.

2. REST allows to use any data type: JSON, XML, etc... SOAP - only xml.

3. REST use HTTP protocol, SOAP - is a protocol itself that is based on HTTP.

HTTP request consists of 2 things: header and body.

- Header - for meta data (properties that describe data: Content type, File size, API key, user role, etc..)

- Body - for content: JSON or XML payload.

- endpoint - where to send the request

- HTTP verb - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc..


RESTful web service 99% use JSON for transferring data.
